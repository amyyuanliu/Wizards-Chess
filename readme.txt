NAME: Wizardâ€™s Chess

DESCRIPTION: This project is a simulation of Wizard's chess from Harry Potter in 2D. This project is a version of chess where you could move the pieces by voice commands. There are two game modes: multiplayer and CPU (implemented with game AI).

HOW TO RUN PROJECT: The user should run the "main.py" file. First, make sure you have wi-fi when running the program because it is needed for the API used. "chess_classes.py", "cpu_mode", "multi_mode.py", "games_shared_functions.py", and "speech_rec.py" should be in the same directory as "main.py". All the chess piece images should be in a directory under the directory containing "main.py" called "pieces" and the directory "images" containing all the other images should also be in the same directory as "main.py". Also, it is recommended that you connect a good microphone source to your computer for a greater accuracy.

LIBRARY INSTALLATIONS: You would need to install the SpeechRecognition API library, which also requires pyAudio. Install pyAudio using "pip install pyaudio" (or "pip3 install pyaudio" for python3) in the command line, and install SpeechRecognition using "pip install SpeechRecognition" (or "pip3 install SpeechRecognition").

SHORTCUT COMMANDS: Pressing the up arrow directs you to the end page, which is normally viewed after a game ends.
