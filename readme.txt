NAME: Wizard’s Chess

DESCRIPTION: This project is a simulation of Wizard's chess from Harry Potter in 2D. It is a version of an animated version of chess where you could move the pieces by voice commands. There are two game modes: multiplayer and CPU (implemented with a Minimax Algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning).

HOW TO RUN PROJECT: The user should run the "main.py" file. First, make sure you are connected to the network when running the program because it is needed for the API used. Also, it is recommended that you connect a good microphone source to your computer for greater accuracy.

LIBRARY INSTALLATIONS: You would need to install the SpeechRecognition API library, which also requires pyAudio. Both should be installed using pip

Independently implemented alogrithms for event and time based animations, checking valid moves, checking for checks/checkmates/stalemates, minimax backtracking, and other rules/features.
